# The Context object is created once by the master script and handed to
# every criterion sub-routine together with the parsed model. It bundles
# everything that is shared across criteria (repo root, list of changed
# files, a lazily-downloaded SAMM CLI jar, git plumbing, ...) so individual
# criteria stay small and don't each re-implement this bookkeeping.

# read without one shelling out to the other. Unlike generate.sh, these go
# into a scratch directory nothing gets committed from. HTML is generated
# without the Catena-X stylesheet (generate.sh's `-c`) here - that flag
